\section*{Introduction}
The purpose of this first assignment was to implement a reinforcement learning task that satisfies the Markov property, known as Markov Decision Process (MDP). To achieve this we used one prey, which is part of the environment and behaves in a known probabilistic way, and one agent, the predator, whose goal is to catch the prey. When that happens the episode ends. The environment we used is a 11 by 11 toroidal grid. Also we assumed that the entire MDP is known to our agent. The agent could thus determine the optimal policy even before interacting with the environment. To program the assignment we used the programming language Java.

\section*{Exercise 1}
In the first part, we simulated the environment keeping the policies of the predator and the prey separate. The predator starts from position $\left<0,0\right>$ and the prey from $\left<5,5\right>$ moving randomly and depending on the given probabilities. The time it takes on average for the predator to catch the prey with random policy is % TODO: Include average step count over 100 runs
, and the standard deviation is % TODO: Include stdev over 100 runs
.

% TODO: Make a simple command line user interface to the code, and tell about it.
% >> What do you want to do?
% >>     1) Run the random simulation for n times
% >>     2) Run ValueIteration
% >>     ...



\section*{Exercise 2}
In order to evaluate the random policy we computed the state-value function $V^{\pi_{random}}$ and determined the following values for the given states:\\

\begin{align*}
V^{\pi_{random}}(\left\{\Pred{0}{0},\Prey{5}{5}\right\}) & = \ldots \\
&= bla \\
&= blabla\\
    V^{\pi_{random}}(\left\{\Pred{2}{3},\Prey{5}{4}\right\}) &= \ldots \\
    V^{\pi_{random}}(\left\{\Pred{2}{10},\Prey{10}{0}\right\}) &= \ldots \\
    V^{\pi_{random}}(\left\{\Pred{10}{10},\Prey{0}{0}\right\}) &= \ldots
\end{align*}

It takes % TODO: Compute sweeps to converge

\section*{Exercise 3}
When naively exploring the state space $\mathcal{S}$, you will have to compute the value for all possible states, depending on four variables (the coordinates of both the predator and prey), each of which can have 11 different values.  This results in $11^4 = 14641$ different states.  Because of the toroidal structure of the world, the state $\left\{\Pred{x}{y}, \Prey{x'}{y'}\right\}$ is equivalent to $\left\{\Pred{x+a}{y+b}, \Prey{x'+a}{y'+b}\right\}$; there is no special square in the given world which has features that distinguish it from other squares.  From this follows that we can fix either $x, y$ or $x', y'$ to a certain value.  By doing so, we have removed two degrees of freedom, and reduced the space to only $11^2 = 121$ unique states.  Note that, when the position of the predator and prey are seen as vectors, this represents the difference vector $\Pred{x}{y} - \Prey{x'}{y'}$ or $\Prey{x'}{y'} - \Pred{x}{y}$, when respectively $x', y'$ or $x, y$ are fixed.  We have chosen to fix $x', y'$, and with $\p{x}{y}$ we denote the class of states for which $\left\{\Pred{x+a}{y+b}, \Prey{a}{b}\right\}$ holds.

\end{figure}

\section*{Exercise 4}
To find an optimal policy we computed the optimal value function $V^\ast$ for all states in which the prey is located at $\left<5,5\right>$.

The convergence speed (in number of iterations) for different discount factors $\gamma$ is presented in \autoref{tab:convVI}.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section*{Exercise 5}
To iteratively improve the policy we implemented policy iteration $V^{\pi^\prime}$ for all states which the prey is located at $\left<5,5\right>$.
